# Hosting

Due to the complexity of properly hosting Im3nsa, it is not recommended to try to host Im3nsa yourself for anything but the largest of installations. Instead, use one of the hosted service providers that have expertise in doing so.

For a highly available installation, you will require:

-   n+1 load balancers routing internet traffic to the Django and Message Mage components
-   n+1 web server front ends running the Django frontend
-   n+1 web servers front ends running the Message Mage frontend
-   A PostgreSQL server with a hot standby
-   A Redis server with a hot standby
-   n+1 Celery instances for each of the Im3nsa queues. (celery, msgs, flows, handler)

Note that hosting your own version of Im3nsa is not an easy affair, the codebase changes daily and you'll want to stay up to date with the latest changes in order to have the latest features and bug fixes.

Again, unless you are doing a large deployment of your own and have experience running large software deployments, we do not recommend running Im3nsa yourself.

## Server Guidelines

Though the hardware required to run Im3nsa at scale changes based on various optimizations made in the code, here are some rough guidelines for running a cluster capable of handling millions of messages per week.

-   Web and Celery Servers - 3 servers - 4 Xeon CPUs, 16 gigs of RAM
-   Redis Servers - 2 servers - 2 Xeon CPUs, 8 gigs of RAM
-   DB Servers - 8 Xeon CPUs, 30 gigs of RAM

The configuration of gunicorn and celery workers is highly dependent on the kind of hardware you have, but given the above, these should get you started:

-   Django - 10 gunicorn workers
-   Default Celery Queue - 1-8 dynamic workers
-   Handler Celery Queue - 1-8 dynamic workers
-   Flow Celery Queue - 1-6 dynamic workers
-   Msgs Celery Queue - 1-12 dynamic workers
