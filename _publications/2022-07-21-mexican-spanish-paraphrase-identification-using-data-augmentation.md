excerpt: 'For the current work, I joined the Laboratory for Applied ontology as an intern, conducting
research on the BPMLs and methodologies, reviewing the works done by Aagesen and Krogstie in
(Aagesen, et al., 2010), and Recker and others (Recker, et al., 2008), (Recker, et al., 2005), Recker
and Rosemann (Recker, et al., 2007) and Gruninger in (Gruninger, 2009), and also conducting my
own studies, evaluating the languages premises with respect to DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for
Linguistics and Cognitive Engineering) (Masolo, et al. 2003)'

# Abstract
Reorganizing words in a passage using synonyms and different words without changing the main
message delivered in the original sentence is called paraphrasing. Simplifying, clarification or taking
quotes, etc. In this paper, we address a Paraphrase Identification model for Mexican Spanish text pairs.
A data augmentation step was done using Google Translate API, and then three different similarity
algorithms, namely: Jaccard, Cosine, and Spacy similarity were used to create a similarity vector for each
text pair. The paraphrase identification task was modeled as binary classification of text pairs into two
classes, namely: Paraphrases and Not-Paraphrases. The proposed methodology with voting classifier of
three machine learning classifiers obtained a F1-score of 0.8754 for paraphrases category.
