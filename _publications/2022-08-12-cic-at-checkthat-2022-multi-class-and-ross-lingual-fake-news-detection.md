# Abstract
Nowadays, social media is one widely used platform to access information. Fake news on social media
and various other media is widely spreading. It is a matter of serious concern due to its ability to cause
a lot of social and national damage with destructive impacts. Therefore, detecting misleading news
is critical to detect automatically. Fake news detection software has been used in a variety of fields,
such as social media, health, political news, etc. This paper presents the Instituto Polit√©cnico Nacional
(Mexico) at CheckThat! 2022. In this paper, we discuss using different algorithms for the multiclass and
cross-lingual fake news detection task. We achieved a macro F1-score of 28.60% for a mono-lingual task
in English (task 3a) using RoBERTa pre-trained model and 17.21% for a cross-lingual task for English and
German (task 3b) using Bi-LSTM deep learning algorithm.
