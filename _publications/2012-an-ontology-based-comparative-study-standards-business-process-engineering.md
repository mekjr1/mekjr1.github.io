# Abstract
Since before the beginning of the millennium, many companies started to look for ways to
optimize their business processes in order to improve productivity and/or improve efficiency and
increase their results, towards that goal, along with the companies many scholars joined the in this
new challenging field, proposing new ideas on how to plan the business processes, they came up
with several process modelling languages, some of them proposing ideas based on well-known
techniques and methodologies while the others where proposing new and invigorating ideas. In this
way many Business Process Modelling Languages were created, ranging from general purpose
Business Process Modelling to some more field specific Process Modelling Languages.
With the increase of computer-based agents and the need for automation of processes allied with
the need for integration and interoperability among systems and processes as well, starting from
internal interoperability to a more external interoperability which goes beyond simple exchange of
information, calls for new ways of process modelling. In order to account for all the three aspects of
interoperability, Technical Interoperability, Policy Interoperability and Semantic Interoperability,
and not only the former which is what usually happens.
For the current work, I joined the Laboratory for Applied ontology as an intern, conducting
research on the BPMLs and methodologies, reviewing the works done by Aagesen and Krogstie in
(Aagesen, et al., 2010), and Recker and others (Recker, et al., 2008), (Recker, et al., 2005), Recker
and Rosemann (Recker, et al., 2007) and Gruninger in (Gruninger, 2009), and also conducting my
own studies, evaluating the languages premises with respect to DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for
Linguistics and Cognitive Engineering) (Masolo, et al. 2003), developed at the LOA (Laboratory
for Applied Ontology), checking for the ontological choices ranging from the objectives behind the
language to the intuitions behind the language constructs, good element categorization, and also the
axiomatization of the relationships.
In an initial phase following languages were targeted BPMN (Business Process Modeling and
Notation), BPEL (Business Process Execution Language), XPDL (XML Business Process
Definition Language), PSL (Process Specification Language) and YAWL(Yet Another Workflow
Language) but, during the course of work, three of them (XPDL, YAWL and BPEL) were dropped
for various reasons.
As the result of the study, BPMN proved to have many ontological deficiencies and to be
inappropriate for automated interoperable processes, while PSL proved to be very useful for process
exchange and excellent for interoperable processes due to its very powerful ontology but at the
same time it proven to be inappropriate for process modeling, for it is design to specify one time
instances.
