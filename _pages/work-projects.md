Below are anonymized examples of project types and outcomes (company names intentionally omitted):

### Omnichannel Support Automation (Telecom)
- Challenge: Fragmented self-service, inconsistent knowledge retrieval.
- Solution: Unified conversational layer (chat/voice) with retrieval-augmented orchestration and robust state handling.
- Outcome: Increased containment and reduced agent escalations.

### Intelligent Document Processing (Finance)
- Challenge: Manual review of multi-format financial statements.
- Solution: Modular pipeline (OCR + extraction + validation + LLM consistency heuristics).
- Outcome: Shortened review cycle; higher data quality confidence.

### Real Estate Negotiation Agent (Property Technology)
- Challenge: Slow, manual multi-party offer negotiation.

- Solution: Multi-tenant backend with validated psychological inventories and secure routing.
- Outcome: Reliable assessment delivery blueprint; roadmap for adaptive guidance.

### Voice AI Debt Resolution (Operations)
- Challenge: Inefficient outbound contact cycles.
- Solution: Voice agent stack (SIP/WebRTC) with reasoning layer and event-driven call state tracking.
- Outcome: Automated routine interactions; reduced manual workload.

### Computer Vision Retail PoC (Retail)
- Challenge: Need for rapid product identification.
- Solution: Object detection integrated with reasoning assistant for operator support.
- Outcome: Demonstrated feasibility and informed investment decisions.

### GenAI Readiness & Enablement (Multiple Sectors)
- Activities: Diagnostics, lens analysis, architecture whiteboarding, prioritised roadmap.
- Outcome: Clear phased adoption plan aligned to value and risk mitigation.

### Multi-agent Document Intelligence (Legal/Financial)
